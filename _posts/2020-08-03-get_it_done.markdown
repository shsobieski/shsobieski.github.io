Using Trello Boards to organize a project. 

There's no denying that starting a new data science project can be intimidating. With thousands of data points to analyse, no way of knowing how clean the data is before EDA, and a seemingly endless number of potential pitfalls making a perfect plan can seem like a Sisyphean task. 
Every time you think you understand your task completely something comes up that changes everything. When I'm about to embark on  a new project trello boards always help me to organize my tasks and stay motivated as I get the job done, so I compiled a short list of tips that I use when using trello boards so hopefully they can help someone else.
Remember Why you Have a Board
Trello boards can help anyone accomplish any complex task, and they can be especially useful when working with teams. But above all the organizational help that they provide I believe there is one overriding reason to use a trello board. Whenever I move a box from one column to the next it makes me feel good, and that keeps me motivated. Whatever reason you have for using a board don't forget it, because that will be your guiding light for how to best use it. 
Start with Big Ideas
The most overwhelming part of a new data science project is trying to think up all the minute details that need to be done to have a  successful, professional project. That's why I advise to start with the big ideas. You can always add details later. Remember the idea of the Trello board is to make your project easier to manage, not harder, so start with the broad ideas and make them more specific as necessary. 
Don't Be Afraid to Make More Boards
Nesting tasks one within the other may seem cluttered at first, but trust me, having more boxes to check off the list gives you the endorphin boost you need to stay motivated when tasks seem overwhelming. Often that means zooming in on certain tasks and sometimes  making an entirely new board to represent a box on the main board. You can find add-ons that provide this functionality, but I find it a little more streamlined in most cases to divide the boards up.
Use a Drafted Column on your board
The classic Trello board columns are "To do",  "doing" and "done". But what about "nearly done", or "done... unless something changes", or even worse "done... until my boss looks at it". The whole point of trello boards is to organize your tasks in a way that is visual and easy to understand. My advice is to use a "drafted" column to organize the tasks that are probably complete, but may need some tweaks. That will save you from the unmotivating need for moving something backwards in the workflow. 
Trust the board
Halfway through a project though you may realize that what you thought was one task was actually two, or that something you initially planned on doesn't fit with the project any longer. Tweaking the board in these moments may seem productive, but before you make a change think twice. Reorganizing your board can often be a form of procrastination.
