When I first started playing guitar I spent half an hour a day learning to work my fingers into the appropriate positions to play the chords. At first it was slow, then I began getting calluses on my fingers, and slowly but surely I learned my first chord. After that, I learned a few more, and before I knew it I was playing for multiple hours a day. My journey from newbie to moderately skilled musician could be graphed like this:

My point is that if you want to improve at anything, data can help you analyze that improvement. That analysis is how we can know what getting better means, which methods are providing the best results, and where to focus our efforts if we seek to boost development for the future.  

Take another example; I was an elementary school teacher for seven years. When I needed to know what to teach my students next I didn’t simply move on to the next subject in the curriculum, I used results from tests and quizzes to inform my decision. Additionally, I used what I knew about each student and their learning styles to help me develop a plan for how to teach it. 

For any given student I had to manage these factors to decide on a plan. Gathering and applying data didn’t just help my students grow, it also helped me grow in my skills as a teacher. 

As a teacher, I was on the front lines of preparing the next generation for the rapidly changing real world. In many ways I succeeded, and I’m proud of the work that I did and the lives that I affected. But as a data scientist I can supercharge teachers with the tools and analysis to hone and perfect their craft. That’s why I want to be a data scientist.

I believe the primary skill that the children of today will need to succeed is the ability to adapt. Throughout their lifetimes people will need the skills to master many skills and learn a variety of things. Most of all, they’ll need to love learning. Because of this, teachers will also have to shift from teaching students what to learn, to teaching them how to learn. Using data science to inform that shift and help improve the science of teaching is the next phase of my career.

I am passionate about making the world a better place, and by working with like-minded people in the Educational Technology sector I believe that I can turn that ambition into reality.
