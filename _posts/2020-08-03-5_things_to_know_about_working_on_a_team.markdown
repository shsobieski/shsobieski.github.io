Working on a team is something that doesn't come easily to everyone. As someone who has planned curriculum units with my colleagues for years, collaboration is a skill I brought to the team before I ever heard of Data Science. And throughout all those experiences as a team member I picked up a few things that helped me to respect my teammates ideas, and their time. Here are some of the core values that I believe make a strong team. 
1. Communicate Early and Often
Holding team meetings regularly may seem dull some days when the project is running smoothly, but just because regular meetings are boring doesn't mean they aren't necessary. Regular check ins allow every team member to understand how the project is getting done in case they need to help someone else with a more challenging role. Teams that understand the project in a holistic way are more adaptable when one part of the plan is more difficult than anticipated.  
2. Define the Objective Clearly
The intention of teamwork is to make the job easier. That simply won't work if the members of the team don't clearly understand the objective of the project. Make sure to spend time early in the process understanding the end goal, and if there are any questions get them answered. Nothing ruins productivity like a team that's working toward separate goals. If every team member not only understands what the project entails by also the why it needs to happen it will allow team members to be far more independent in their roles, saving everyone time and effort.
3. Share Expectations and Live up to them
Daily check ins are a great time to share short term goals. As opposed to how understanding the bigger picture can help every team member succeed in their role, when it comes to these goals knowing every little thing can be overwhelming. It's best to communicate your goal for the day and nothing more. If your goal takes more time than expected, that's okay sometimes, but in many projects your teammates are relying on your work before they can get theirs done, so don't bite off more than you're willing to chew. 
4. Ask for Help
If you're struggling to live up to expectations, before blaming yourself ask your team for support. It could be that the roles you defined early on in the process aren't working for everyone, or that expectations as a whole are too ambitious. It's best to be realistic, because being over ambitious won't help the team succeed in the long run. That will only lead to burnout.
5. Get to Know your Teammates
This piece of advice is probably the most important thing I can share. When I picture the most successful teams that I've been a part of, they all have one thing in common. Mutual respect fostered from genuinely seeing each other as human beings. Does that mean that successful teams must be full of best friends? Not at all, but when every team member feels a personal connection to the team it creates an environment of respect and accountability.
