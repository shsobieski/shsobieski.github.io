Fundamentally, this project shifted my entire workflow prospects for the future. I found that working from a goal that dictated what I hoped the data could tell me was flawed. I attempted to use all of the data, instead of getting a more specific story by clearing away outliers. What I found was that outliers didn't help me reach further with my analysis, it only prevented me from going deeper. In this sense, I discovered that data science is less like exploring a vast national park and more like spelunking in the Carlsbad caverns. There are still infinite possibilities of directions to go, but far more boundaries of where you cannot. Learning this lesson will lead me to explore and deeply understand the data before I attempt to analyze it our get it to tell a story.
