### 1. Choose data carefully.
### 2. Careful with what code you place in the same box
If you ever drop something in the same box as looking at it, you can't go back and rerun the box without rerunning the whole notebook.
### 3. Naming Variables
### 4. Seek opportunities for flexibility in funcitons
Split functions into chunks.
### 5. Write functions one piece at a time.
This makes it far easier.
### 6. Have a process for naming figures
### 7. Plan backwards
### 8. Format as you go
### 9. Write the README and code at the same time
### 10. SAVE OFTEN
