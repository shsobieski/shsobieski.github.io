After my first project I learned so much. 

### 1. Plan backwards

This is a lesson I bring from the world of teaching. When I was planning a lesson, I always thought "What is the student expected to know at the end of this?" before thinking "how do I get there?" I was so eager to dig into the data with this project that I forgot that very valuable lesson. Start with the end in mind.

### 2. Stay Organized 

Careful with what code you place in the same box. Especially when joining lists or making new dataframes I frequently made the mistake of dropping data in the same box as using it, or manipulating columns in boxes I was testing. Because of this, instead of running only the box again and again while I got it right I had to rerun the entire notebook. Save yourself some time and separate your code until it's done.

### 3. Format as you go

I wish that I had understood how simple it was to format as I went. As a student used to the typical work flow of write, review edit, I underestimated how time intensive formatting already written code could be. Make sure your code is in the proper format as you write it, and avoid the mistake of leaving 'editing' for last.

### 4. Write the README and code at the same time

Not only will this help save time, it will also be helpful to guide your formating. Next time I work on a long bit of code I'll be splitting my screen between the README and the code. It will save time, and help me be as accurate as possible with my thinking.

### 5. Write functions one piece at a time.

Functions that do a series of tasks that often go together are great. I made functions for just about everything in this project, and not only did it save me time and space, it was fun. Functions can be the most interesting puzzles, and I had a blast making them more and more complex. What I also learned was to sperate them if they do multiple things that even maybe, possibly, might not go together every time. Adapting a long function to serve another purpose is time intensive, and it won't always be possible to simply add a key word argument to give your function the flexibilty to do two things well.

### 6. Have a process for naming figures

This is more for organization than anything. Once I had a large collection of figures I couldn't find them in the file without checking a few similarly named ones. Next time I'll use numbers associated with each section of code to make them as easy as possible to find after they've been saved. 

### 7. Use Copy and Paste

This is an accuracy issue. Before long I found myself using copy and paste for single words and simple changes, and not so much because it helped me be faster, although it did, but because when I copied and pasted I had confidence that the changes I was adding were accurate and the same every time.

### 8. Naming Variables

Finding the right balance between descriptivness and length is difficult. The thing that I would advise is that your code is meant to be read by other people, so writing variable names in a code that only you understand is not a good thing to do. In other words in the battle between length and descriptivness, error on the side of descriptivness

### 9. Choose Data Wisely

There is so much data out there. When I started this project I assumed that meant, the more the better. What I found was much of it was redundant, or easy to replace with a more organized source. What I did was clean every bit of data i had before making a plan of how to use it. What I should have done was make a plan first and save myself time. 

### 10. SAVE OFTEN

This is self explanatory. Save, then save, then save again. Like saying "I love you" to your family, don't regret not doing it more!
