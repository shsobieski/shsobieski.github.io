There is something that has always bugged me about the way people compare themselves to each other. "They have a better job", "they have a cooler car", "they have this" and "they have that". Fundamentally, these kinds of comparisons don't make any sense. Just because another person has more cool stuff than you doesn't mean they are happier. We all know that.

But we all make these comparisons anyway and the reason is simple: we can't measure happiness, so we naturally use something else that is measurable. It's just one of the many examples of why Goodhart's Law rules the world. 

Goodhart's Law states that "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." In Goodhart's field of economics it means that once people are aware of a reward or punishment their behavior will adjust to increase their reward. For example, a salesperson that works on commission wants to sell every customer the most expensive item they can convince them to buy... whether or not it is the best product. 

In the comparison example I used before it highlights my central point: 
We must be careful when using data to define "success". 
Of course, as a data scientist, it is my job to find ways to measure the un-measurable. But if not done with care, measuring certain things will lead to disaster. Happiness is just one example; we can't measure it directly, so as a proxy we compare the things that we can see with other people. As I'm sure you've experienced at least once in your life, this can lead to very unhealthy habits.

But if you look around, you'll find examples everywhere. Using the stock market to measure the economy may seem like a good idea until you realize that, according to Gallup polling, since 2010 the average percent of Americans that own stock is only 55%. Does the stock market really measure the economy if it doesn't even impact 45% of Americans? Policy makers that use stock market indicators to measure the success of their policies are ignoring 45% of the population. 

I'm not trying to argue that measuring things in and of itself is wrong, my livelihood is data after all. But as a data scientist it is vital that I be keenly aware of what a measurement means, what it applies to, and how best to use it. 

There are examples of people, companies, and governments applying irrelevant or misleading statistics to tell a story that they don't literally everywhere we look. And that fact coupled with Goodhart's law can lead to some very negative decisions.
