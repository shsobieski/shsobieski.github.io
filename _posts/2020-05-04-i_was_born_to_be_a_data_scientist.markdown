Asking questions runs deep in my blood. I'll never forget the time I spent voraciously reading every entry in my children's encyclopedia, only to have an infinite supply of new questions from my parents. I can still smell the musty scent of the library that I would visit with my siblings, where instead of running around the stacks like normal children we would gather around and read whatever captured our imagination. Deep learning is fundamental to who I am; it is my most precious skill and most powerful motivation. Before I even knew what it was, I was born to be a Data Scientist.
